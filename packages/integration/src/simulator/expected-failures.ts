 * Re-chosen after the hardening of 31aefa1d (docs/investigations/simulator-baseline-2026-10-14.md
 * §7.5). No listed defect was fixed by it: replayed from their pre-hardening decisions on the new
 * code, seeds 1 (B1), 41 (B4) and 89 (B8) fail their old keys again, and seed 18 (B3) does once
 * its database fault is moved two occurrences later, past the boot query each of its two boots
 * now sends first. They stopped failing because the draws were one stream, so that one query
 * re-rolled every seed; the tape now draws per key (tape.ts) and the fast tier was re-chosen on
 * it: B1 seed 1 -> 4, B4 seed 41 -> 14. B8 has no seed in 1-300 on the keyed tape and is pinned
 * by a two-decision tape in simulator.test.ts instead of seed 89. B3 was seed 119 until the rebase
 * onto 4d40d185: model fault keys carry the model id, migration 047 replaced the catalog's models
 * (gpt-4-1, which the stand-ins were routed to, is deleted), and seed 119 lost its orphan. A seed whose failure needs a crash and then a fault on one reconciler query is re-rolled
 * by any such change, so B3 is pinned by its minimized three-decision tape there too. B1 (seed 4)
 * is removed: a check set keeps only the files under checks/<checked task id>/ (MVP W4), and seed 4
 * then fails none of its I3 product-file keys (observed: its listed keys were reported missing).
